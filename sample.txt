<p><strong>Web</strong> has been around for more than 25 years now, experiencing euphoric 
early expansion, an economic-driven bust, an innovation-driven rebirth, and 
constant evolution along the way. One thing is certain: the web as a communication and commercial medium is here to stay. Not only that, it has found 
its way onto devices such as smartphones, tablets, TVs, and more.</p> 
<p>There have 
never been more opportunities to put web design know-how to use.
 Through my experience teaching web design courses and workshops, I’ve 
had the opportunity to meet people of all backgrounds who are interested 
in learning how to build web pages. Allow me to introduce you to just a few:

<p><em>“I’ve been a print designer for 17 years, and now I am feeling pressure to pro
vide web design services.”
 “I’ve been a programmer for years, but I want shift my skills to web develop
ment because there are good job opportunities in my area.</em>”</p>
<p><em>“I tinkered with web pages in high school and I think it might be something 
I’d like to do for a living.”
 “I’ve made a few sites using themes in WordPress, but I’d like to expand my 
skills and create custom sites for small businesses.</em>”</p>
<p><em>Whatever the motivation, the first question is always the same: “Where do I 
start?” It may seem like there is a mountain of stuff to learn, and it’s not easy 
to know where to jump in. But you have to start somewhere.</em></p>
